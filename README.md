# An End to End Deep Neural Network for Iris Segmentation in Unconstrained Scenarios
This repository contains the code for the method presented in the following paper:

**Bazrafkan, S., Thavalengal, S. and Corcoran, P., 2017. An End to End Deep Neural Network for Iris Segmentation in Unconstraint Scenarios. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.02877. https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02877**

\
The file "DBaug.m" performs the database augmentation (section 2.2 of the paper), which has been written in MATLAB R2017a x64.

\
The network and test files are witten in python 2.7 with Lasagne 0.2 on top of Theano 0.9.0
Due to copyright issues we are not able to share the original databases.

Researchers might obtain the oiginal images themselves.
